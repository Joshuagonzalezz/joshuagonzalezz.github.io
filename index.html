        <div class="subheading mb-5">Education Majorüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm an undergraduate attending UC Riverside as an education major looking for an internship that I could dedicate my time and will provide experience that will of benefit to my career. I am seeking long-term employment while being a full-time student. I am flexible and willing to work. I have more than a year of retail fast-paced food service experience while exhibiting excellent customer service, another half year working with a team striving for a consistent and clean environment for our store and I plan to offer excellent customer service skills in both English and Spanish.  I will continue through college to get my bachelors in Education. When I get my teachers credentials in Multi-Subject I plan on carrying that credential until I'm tired of firefighting. I will enter a station through the help of connections, and my own efforts. Starting with my EMT Certification, which I will have done by summer of 2025.I will then start releasing music on the side of my main source of income, and give my all in producing amazing art. <br><br>

       My hometown is very new in population. The growth in my home town has been exponentially large, I do like that there are so many options for food, groceries, places to hang, but for the most part, I love the people and how kind they can be. People in Menifee are very civil and clean in terms of how they keep the areas clean. The best and most popular place in my town is the Menifee Countryside Marketplace. This area has the big target,lowes, In N Out, and Red Robbin, ice cream like Baskin Robins, Gamestop and more. It has all the keys things a market should have. My hometown has a vast and expansive amounts of entry level jobs that are offered and have opportunities to continue to grow in experience if needed. The services skills I‚Äôve acquired working in both fast food and as a produce clerk have given the minimum experience to dealing with individuals of all ages, which I excell at.<br><br>

      In my free time I continue to play the Alto Saxophone. This instrument I've been playing for 7 years, competitively in Marching and Jazz. This is my favorite hobby/life. I love music because of my love for my instrument. I also rollerblade which I've been doing for 8 years. I like to play basketball on my extra free days, and go to the gym. I play videos games like Supersmash bros to keep my skills in check.As a Highlander experience, I want to be more involved with clubs. I think finding more of a constant friend in the school has been more of a challenge since I commute so I tend to stick with my friends at home. Hiking the C was brought up to me by one of my campus buddies, they mentioned it would be fun in the summer so I've been waiting for that. I want to experience eating Pho with my friend/s and visit the Botanical Gardens, since I have never been.
